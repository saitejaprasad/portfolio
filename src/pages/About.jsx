          I’m SaiTeja Prasad Sunkara, a curious and hands on learner with a
          passion for technology, data, and problem solving. Alongside my web
          development skills in Node.js, Express, and React, I’ve gained a
          strong foundation in business analytics and data science, applying
          insights to drive smarter decisions. I’m also proficient in multiple
          programming languages Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and .NET which
          allows me to approach challenges from both a software development and
          analytical perspective. Recently, I’ve always been expanding my
          toolkit with technologies like Tailwind CSS and next js to sharpen the
          design and functionality of my projects.

          What excites me most is problem solving whether it’s debugging tricky
          issues, mapping out clean logic, or turning raw concepts into elegant,
          functional code. My goal is to craft impactful digital experiences
          while building a portfolio that not only demonstrates technical
          expertise but also reflects creativity and thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I’m always eager to grow whether through mentorship,
          experimenting with new frameworks, or refining how I present myself
          and my work. I see every challenge as an opportunity to learn, and I’m
          committed to shaping a career that blends innovation with continuous
          learning and self improvement.
